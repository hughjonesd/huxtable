Note about markdown vs. \code{print_md()}
}
\section{Note}{

Markdown content in cells is completely separate from printing the whole
table as markdown using \code{\link[=print_md]{print_md()}}. When you set \code{markdown} to \code{TRUE},
huxtable itself interprets the cell contents as markdown, and spits out HTML,
TeX or whatever.
