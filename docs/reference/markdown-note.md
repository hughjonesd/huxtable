# Note about markdown vs. `print_md()`

Note about markdown vs. [`print_md()`](to_md.md)

## Note

Markdown content in cells is completely separate from printing the whole
table as markdown using [`print_md()`](to_md.md). When you set
`markdown` to `TRUE`, huxtable itself interprets the cell contents as
markdown, and spits out HTML, TeX or whatever.
