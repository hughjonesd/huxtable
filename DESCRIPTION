Description: Creates HTML and LaTeX tables. Provides similar 
  functionality to 'xtable', but does more, with a simpler interface. Allows export to
  'Microsoft Word' or 'PowerPoint' using the 'officer' package. Includes  a 'huxreg' function 
  for creation of regression tables, and 'quick_*' one-liner commands to print data as Word, 
  PDF or HTML documents.
