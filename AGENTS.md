At the end of any task, if you've made changes, run the tests in tests/testthat 
to make sure everything is still working. If there are errors due to your code, 
fix them before completing. You don't have to run every test; in particular those
in test-yy-end-to-end.R and test-zz-fuzz.R may take a long time so you may want 
to skip those, or even just run a single test file if you're confident. Github 
will run a full suite of tests later.

Don't change the API without asking first.

Not all packages in Suggests: in the DESCRIPTION file are installed. You
can install them if you need to. But, if tests break because a suggested
package is not installed, then that is a bug and you should probably fix it by
using `skip_if_not_installed()` - in a separate PR if possible.
