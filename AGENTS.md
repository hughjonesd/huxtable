At the end of any task, if you've made changes, run the tests in tests/testthat to make sure everything is still working. If there are errors due to your code, fix them before completing. You don't have to run every test; in particular those in test-yy-end-to-end.R and test-zz-fuzz.R may take a long time so you may want to skip those, or even just run a single test file if you're confident. Github will run a full suite of tests later.

Don't change the API without asking first.
